                Hi, I’m <span class="text-red">28</span> years old, a passionate front-end developer with a creative mindset and a strong drive for self-improvement. 
                I excel at teamwork and thrive in solving complex problems by crafting innovative and tailored solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey into front-end development began when I sought new challenges, and I quickly fell in love with the creative and technical aspects of web development. 
                Over the past year, I have built expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, including:
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">HTML5</span> 
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">CSS3</span> 
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">JavaScript</span> 
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">jQuery</span> 
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">PHP</span> 
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">MySQL</span> 
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">Laravel</span> 
                <span class="text-red">&#x21A3;</span><span class="text-gold">Vue.js</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these skills, I create end-to-end web applications that are both visually appealing and technically robust, managing everything from user interfaces to server-side logic and database design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working as a freelancer on various client projects, continually broadening my skill set and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. 
                My approach combines creativity, problem-solving, and a commitment to delivering solutions that align with my clients’ goals. 
                Above all, I am dedicated to continuous learning, always seeking to enhance my abilities and push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
